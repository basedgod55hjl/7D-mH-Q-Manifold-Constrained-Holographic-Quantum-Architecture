# Hyperbolic ML Research Platform

## Overview

Research sandbox for experimenting with hyperbolic geometry in machine learning.
Implements Poincaré ball embeddings, hyperbolic attention, and Φ-scaled training.

## Components

- `embeddings.py` - Hyperbolic word/token embeddings
- `attention.py` - Hyperbolic attention mechanisms
- `trainer.py` - Φ-optimized training loop
- `datasets.py` - Dataset loaders and preprocessing
