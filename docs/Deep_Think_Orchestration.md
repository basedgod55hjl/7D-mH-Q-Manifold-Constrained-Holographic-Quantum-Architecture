# Deep Think: Neural Orchestration & Sovereign Workflow

## The Logic Loop

**Deep Think** is the highest level of the 7D Crystal Universe. It represents the orchestrator's ability to self-reflect, observe its own state through "Vision Blocks," and execute atomic tools to manipulate the manifold.

## Core Loop Phases

### 1. Geometric Observation

The orchestrator reads current CPU/GPU telemetry and manifold stability ratios. It projects this state into a 7D latent space.

### 2. Deep Think (Cognitive Block)

The LLM generates high-order reasoning between `<THINK>` and `</THINK>` tags. These blocks are isolated from the output stream to allow for unfiltered logic generation.

### 3. Tool Execution

Once logic is finalized, the orchestrator parses `<TOOL_CALL>` blocks.

- **FS Execution**: Modifying source code or configs.
- **CUDA Ops**: Re-centering the manifold if drift is detected.
- **Vision Scan**: Screenshot analysis of the current environment.

### 4. Self-Refactoring

The system can rewrite its own `tooling/core` modules if optimizations are identified during the Deep Think cycle.

## Sovereign Commands

- `⑦(vector) -> manifold`: Atomic projection operator.
- `Λ(x)`: Cognitive lambda constant.
- `Ψ(y)`: System psi entropy.
